# Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in the C programming language. 

## Current Structures

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Unbalanced BST supporting insert, search, and destroy operations.
- **Semaphore (Custom)**: User-space counting semaphore built using `pthread_mutex_t` and `pthread_cond_t`, with `sem_init`, `sem_wait`, and `sem_post` operations.
